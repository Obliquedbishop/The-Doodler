# The-Doodler
It creates random doodles for you, based on google's quickdraw API.

## Functioning
Just click anywhere on the opened screen and a doodle will be drawn there.
You can even modify that doodle, like rescaling it, rotating it etc.
If you're interested in this idea and want to add more features, go for it. I would be more than happy to help :)
